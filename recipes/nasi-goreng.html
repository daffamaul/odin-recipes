        Prepare Ingredients: Gather and prepare all the ingredients needed for
        your nasi goreng. Chop vegetables, dice protein, mince garlic, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook Rice: If you don't already have cooked rice, cook it according to
        package instructions. It's best to use day-old rice for nasi goreng, as
        it tends to fry up better without becoming mushy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat Oil: Heat a wok or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add
        cooking oil and allow it to heat up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté Aromatics: Add finely chopped shallots or onions to the hot oil
        and sauté until they become translucent. Then add minced garlic and
        chopped chilies if you're using them, and sauté for another minute until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Protein: Add your chosen protein (chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc.) to
        the pan. Stir-fry until the protein is cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Vegetables: Add thinly sliced vegetables to the pan. Common choices
        include carrots, peas, bell peppers, and cabbage. Stir-fry for a few
        minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened but still crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with Sauces: Pour in kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) or a mixture
        of soy sauce and brown sugar for sweetness. Adjust the amount according
        to your taste preferences. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Rice: Add the cooked rice to the pan. Use a spatula to break up any
        clumps and evenly distribute the rice with the other ingredients.
        Stir-fry everything together until the rice is heated through and
        well-coated with the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and Adjust: Taste the nasi goreng and adjust the seasoning if
        needed. You can add more soy sauce, kecap manis, or spices according to
        your preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Once everything is cooked and seasoned to your liking, transfer
        the nasi goreng to serving plates or bowls. Garnish with optional
        toppings like fried shallots, sliced cucumber, tomato wedges, a fried
        egg, and fresh cilantro or spring onions.
      </li>
      <li>
